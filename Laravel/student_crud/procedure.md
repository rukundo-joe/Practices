##  How to work on a laravel project ##
# We are going to use an example of a CRUD app to understand how laravel works. So, after the fresh installation of a laravel project with 'laravel new app_name' or 'composer create-project laravel/laravel app_name' commands the next thing to do is creating a database in our DBMS then setup the environment which we have to work in. To setup the environment, just open the '.env' file located in the project directory, in it we'll configure the database environment: The normal '.env' DB configuration looks like: 

# DB_CONNECTION=mysql
# DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
# DB_PORT=3306
# DB_DATABASE=student_crud
# DB_USERNAME=root
# DB_PASSWORD=

#So, you re-modify it as of your own environment setup.
