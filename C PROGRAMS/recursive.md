**Explanation of Recursive Functions:**
A recursive function is a function that calls itself within its own definition. It breaks down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving each subproblem and combining the results to obtain the final solution.

In the provided C program, the calculateSum function is a recursive function used to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to a given value (n in this case). Here's how it works:

The calculateSum function takes an integer n as an argument.
The base case is defined using an if statement. If n is 0, it means we have reached the smallest subproblem, and the function returns 0.
If n is not 0, the function recursively calls itself with n - 1 as the argument. This is the recursive step, as it breaks down the problem into a smaller subproblem.
The function adds n to the result of the recursive call and returns the sum.
In the main function, we call calculateSum with the value 100 and store the result in the variable sum.
Finally, we display the result using printf.
In this particular example, the recursive function calculates the sum of numbers from 0 to 100 by continuously reducing the value of n until it reaches the base case (0), and then adds the values together during the unwinding of the recursive calls.

Recursive functions are useful when solving problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems. However, it's important to ensure that recursive functions have a well-defined base case and that they eventually reach it to avoid infinite recursion.
